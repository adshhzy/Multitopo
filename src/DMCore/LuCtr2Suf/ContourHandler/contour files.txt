1. .contour
represented as a set of planes with contour vertices and contour edges.

If two planes share contour vertices, it's not necessary that the intersected vertcies already exists, preprocessing will take care of that

  (.contour + comnL)
a set of planes sharing the same common line.

2. .contour2
a set of planes, potentially include at most one set of planes sharing a common line.
For each plane, besides contour vertices and contour edges, it also saves the intersected contour vertices indices between plane-i and all planes (plane-0..plane-(n-1). Assumption is that there are at most two intersected points, if both are -1, meaning there is no intersection point, otherwise, the intersection points indices in plane-i's contour vertices. In this kind of format, all intersected contour vertices have to be precomputed and saved in the file

3. .ctrGraph
All planes share the same set of contour vertices.
The file starts with all the contour vertices, and then followed by all the planes. Each plane has a set of contour edges(v1, v2, m1, m2).
